I'm a Master's Student at the University of Utah living in Salt Lake City, Utah. My interests lie in the fields of Cloud Computing, Distributed Systems and Algorithmic Problem Solving. I will be graduating by May 2018 and in search of pursuing a professional career in my areas of interest.

I'm currently working as a Research Assistant under [Robert Ricci](http://www.flux.utah.edu/users/ricci/) in the [Flux lab](https://www.flux.utah.edu/) at UoU analyzing the University Network data for my thesis.

Prior to my masters at U, I worked as a Software Engineer for two years at J.P.Morgan Chase. My experience here comprises of Web Development in Java and Python.

Research Expereince

[Research Assistant](https://tejakommineni.github.io/) - As a Research Assistant at U, I work at Flux lab in the areas of Networking and Systems trying to ease the way systems and networks are managed in an enterprise setting.(August 2016 - Present)

**Markdown generator**

I have also created [a set of Jupyter notebooks](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/tree/master/markdown_generator
) that converts a CSV containing structured data about talks or presentations into individual markdown files that will be properly formatted for the academicpages template. The sample CSVs in that directory are the ones I used to create my own personal website at stuartgeiger.com. My usual workflow is that I keep a spreadsheet of my publications and talks, then run the code in these notebooks to generate the markdown files, then commit and push them to the GitHub repository.

How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons.
